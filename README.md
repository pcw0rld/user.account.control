Short for User Account Control, UAC is a feature introduced with Windows Vista to provide an extra security by preventing administrative rights to programs unless approved by the user.

Pictured at right is the UAC confirmation dialog box. This confirmation is required when you launch a program, or access a feature of Windows, that requires your permission to run.

## How to disable User Account Control in Windows ?

## How User Account Control Works ?

User Account Control (UAC) helps prevent malicious programs (also called malware) from damaging a computer and helps organizations deploy a better-managed desktop. With UAC, applications and tasks always run in the security context of a non-administrator account, unless an administrator specifically authorizes administrator-level access to the system. UAC can block the automatic installation of unauthorized applications and prevent inadvertent changes to system settings.
